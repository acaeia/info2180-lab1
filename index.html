    <h2>Alexia Barrows</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Alexia Barrows and I'm currently in my second year of university. I gained an interest in web development through a course I participated in the summer of 2022. It went through the basics of HTML and CSS and I thought it was pretty cool how you can customize a page by yourself. Getting to add different elements to a page and see how well they mesh together garnered my attention, thus leading me here.</p>
